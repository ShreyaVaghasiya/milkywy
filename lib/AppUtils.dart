With a diameter of only 4880 kilometers (3032 miles) Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System. It is barely bigger than our Moon. Not only is Mercury the smallest planet, it is also shrinking!'

Mars turns on its axis more slowly than Earth does. So, a day on Mars is 24.6 hours.Mariner 4, which flew by Mars on July 14, 1965, found that Mars has an atmospheric pressure of only 1 to 2 percent of the Earth\'s. Temperatures on Mars average about -81 degrees F. However, temperatures range from around -220 degrees F. in the wintertime at the poles, to +70 degrees F.'
